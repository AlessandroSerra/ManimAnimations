# Manim Animation
This repository was created in order to share the source code and assets for the course "Didattica della Fisica" (Physics Teaching).

## Resources
The engine used to develop the animations is [Mainm Community](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim), which was firstly developed by the creator of the educational YouTube channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) and later forked and adapted to be open source and mantained by the manim community.

## Code & Assets
The main file is [uvetta.py](uvetta.py) is a complete mess of a code, but it works. The other .png and .mp3 files were used to complement the animation.
